## Easy Noms

Easy Noms is a mobile iOS application for the indecisive restaurant goer. It is designed to make choosing a restaurant with others as easy as pie.

We are [Alan Alcesto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aalcesto), [Jack Abernethy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-abernethy-ab257b9b), [David Diaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-diaz-4308ba100), and [Zollie Barnes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zolliebarnes). We created this app for educational and employment purposes over eight days while attending Dev Bootcamp in Chicago.

This repo represents the frontend of our application. You can find the backend [here](https://github.com/ddiaz914/easynoms).

####How does it work?
A restaurant loads on the screen. Would you eat here? No no.

Should we go there now?

If we went through all the restaurants, we would have an opportunity to reload the stack. Or, if we have changed locations, we will get new restaurants all together.
